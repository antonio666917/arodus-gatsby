    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I've worn many hats over my young professional career: front-end
      developer, back-end developer, database administrator, engineering teams
      leader and mentor, solutions consultant, digital marketing technologist,
      creative technologist, chief technology officer, and co-founder. Some of
      these hats I've worn for curiosity and others out of necessity, but I've
      always worn them with passion and drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I simply love how empowering technology can be, directly and indirectly.
      The process of creation, going from a blank document and adding lines and
      lines of code and potentially creating worlds is so stimulating and
      satisfying. We have the best profession in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm 31 years old and finally learning to appreciate and understand what
      things are most important to me, such as family, quality friendships,
      being a compassionate human being, treating yourself, the importance of
      hard work, health and work-life balances. With these discoveries, I find
      myself in a phase of reflection. Do I desire to continue climbing the
      managerial ladder or do I want to return to my roots as a software
      engineer? Stay tuned!
    </p>

    <h2>I f@#&*ing love learning and building things!</h2>
    <p>
      Rolling up my sleeves and executing outside my comfort zones is something
      that I look forward to. I might not be the best and brightest engineer but
      my drive and perseverance will help me achieve viable resolutions to the
      challenges. It's not only about being successful, it's also about the
      learning process and the collaboration involved in facing new things and
      discovering your gallons.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic background is in computer science. This permits me to jump
      around languages, frameworks, design patterns, and the such, with what I
      think is relative ease. One must choose the{" "}
      <Link to="/the-tools">correct tool</Link> for each situation and for this
      reason my <Link to="/the-tools">
        tools, processes, and methodologies
      </Link>{" "}
      are always evolving and under scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm eternally grateful to my parents and college professors for instilling
      what has become a passion for learning. In our field of work, continuous
      education must be a serious commitment if one seeks to be a valuable team
      player and contributor. I also strongly believe that our learning focus
      should not be limited to tech. We should study a little something about
      everything to become well-rounded human beings. One can be a genius at
      functional programming but without some fundamentals on, for example,
      empathy and communication, one could miss out on many good things.
    </p>

    <h2>Violence is a no-go</h2>
    <p>
      Can we truly work solely with someone's skills but not with their being
      and emotions? Sometimes we can, and that's cool. But sometimes people want
      to go to work and develop professional relationships based on trust and
      kindnesses. This is why I attempt to have an empathy-based approach to
      communication and the overall management of things throughout my teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just check out the news and see how the strictly "performance-based" or
      "elitist" approaches in management and leading are working out... I don't
      want to discredit these styles, but my opinion is that we have to achieve
      a balance. As human beings, we have to seek to avoid violence and
      judgment. We have to seek for our coworkers to work with desire,
      commitment, and being proud of the products that we build. There's nothing
      powerful that an engineer that is inspired, empowered, respected, and well
      paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also try to encourage my teams day in and day out to try the next and
      the previous thing. Make a proof-of-concept. Let's philosophize a little
      bit of this approach versus that one. CSS-in-JS is dumb? Why? Let's try it
      out. Oh, you love it now; that's great. Still dislike it? That's ok too.
      Share the learnings with the rest of the teams. Write some docs about it.{" "}
      <strong>Let's do it!</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>#AdLife</h2>

    <p>
      Working out of a marketing agency is fun! Without going into the innate
      craziness of the culture, clients, pace of work, and the office's
      spaces... We get to pick our tech stacks and solutions with virtually no
      restrictions (in most cases) and get to build whatever crazy shit we can
      think of! My teams ship out hundreds of projects each year, each with
      variable scopes of work, difficulty, and duration. And while our top
      deliverables are websites, promotional web-apps, chatbots and a ton of
      custom tools, we build a sweet range of things.
    </p>

    <p>
      My favorite projects, at the moment, are our MINE data platform and
      anything that has artificial intelligence and customer-facing interfaces.
      MINE is a huge analytics, insights and reporting engine that consolidates
      data from hundreds of concurrent media campaigns using Talend, BigQuery,
      custom management tools written in Python, and Tableau for visualization,
      from over 36 data sources of media, social, traffic, placement, revenue
      and other third-party sources for each client. I consider this data
      platform the heart of our agency.
    </p>

    <h2>Something extra</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I'm happily married and currently living in Miami, Florida with my wife
        and our {todayYear - ginosBdayYear}-year old son.
      </li>
      <li>English is my second language.</li>
      <li>I may or may not be a horrible writer.</li>
      <li>
        A regret I have, one which I hope to remedy soon, is my lack of work on
        open source projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Two of my recent business ventures have been acquired but the
        experiences have been more educational than lucrative.
      </li>
      <li>
        This year I've been focusing my efforts on React, GraphQL, NodeJS, the
        Go programming language (as a hobby) and improving my writing, team
        leading and project management skills.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before college I was an avid athlete, practicing Shotokan and gymnastics
        competitively! Nowadays I partake in pick-up basketball and MOBA-style
        games, such as DOTA2.
      </li>
      <li>I love playing guitar.</li>
      <li>
        While working as a network specialist at the University of Puerto Rico's
        main precinct, a friend and I challenged the Dean of Technology to let
        us rebuild the aging website... he accepted and I quickly became the
        Lead Web Developer for the whole precinct! I built a suite of web-based
        student services: enrollment, tuition payments, online grades,
        schedules, academic progress evaluations, and other services. These web
        services are still in use to this date, hopefully with updated source
        code ðŸ˜…!
      </li>
      <li>
        During "the big 2010 student strike" at the University of Puerto Rico, I
        built the first secure electronic referendum system employed by any
        governmental or educational institution in Puerto Rico. It was called
        the "Sistema de Consulta al Estudiante". It was a glorious disaster.
